The Thermo Raw File Reader is a .NET DLL that demonstrates how to read 
Thermo-Finnigan .Raw files using Thermo's MS File Reader, which is 
available on Thermo's website at http://sjsupport.thermofinnigan.com/public/detail.asp?id=703

The Thermo Raw File Reader DLL provides several methods for parsing the information returned by MSFileReader, including:
- Determining the parent ion m/z and fragmentation mode in a given scan filter
- Determining the Ionization mode from a given scan filter
- Extracting MRM masses listed in a given scan filter
- Reporting the number of spectra in the .Raw file
- Returning details on a specific spectrum
- Obtaining the raw m/z and intensity values for a given spectrum

The Test_ThermoRawFileReader folder contains a .NET command-line application 
that illustrates how to interface with ThermoRawFileReaderDLL.dll

Prior to using ThermoRawFileReaderDLL.dll you must either download and install the MSFileReader,
or use batch file registerFiles.bat in the lib folder to register MSFileReader.XRawfile2.dll
