Version 1.1.5989; May 25, 2016
	- Add support for scan filter "p NSI ms"
	- Fix bug validating that an MS1 scan has a known scan filter

Version 1.1.5938; April 4, 2016
	- XRawFileIO now implements IDisposable

Version 1.1.5856; January 13, 2016
	- Added unit tests
	- MakeGenericFinniganScanFilter no longer reports the parent ion m/z for SRM spectra
	- DetermineIonizationMode now reports Unknown for "c NSI Full cnl 162.053 [300.000-1200.000]" instead of Negative
	- ExtractParentIonMZFromFilterText now reports 748.371 for "+ c NSI SRM ms2 748.371 [701.368-701.370]"

Version 1.1.5854; January 11, 2016
	- Add support for Thermo Lumos scan filters of the form 902.5721@etd120.55@cid20.00
		- etd followed by cid is labeled ETciD
		- etd followed by hcd is labeled EThcD

Version 1.1.5767; October 16, 2015
	- Add functions GetScanLabelData and GetScanPrecisionData

Version 1.1.5764; October 13, 2015
	- Add support for scan filter "Full lock ms"

Version 1.1.5665; July 6, 2015
	- Added property ActivationType for ScanInfo
		- Data value comes from a RawFileReader call, in contrast with CollisionMode, which is parsed from the scan filter string
		- Uses enum ActivationTypeConstants
	- Added function TryGetScanEvent to clsScanInfo

Version 1.1.5556; March 19, 2015
	- Now using GetLabelData() to obtained centroided data from high resolution instruments
	- Overloaded GetScanInfo() to an output parameter of type ScanInfo (a class) instead of type udtScanHeaderInfoType (a struct)
	- Now caching ScanInfo so that it does not need to be re-extracted using the DLL for the same dataset

Version 1.1.5521; February 12, 2015
	- Added overloaded versions of GetScanData that return the results using the Out keyword and don't have parameter udtScanHeaderInfo (which is no longer used / needed by GetScanData)

Version 1.1.5500; January 22, 2015
	- Added attribute HandleProcessCorruptedStateExceptions to CloseRawFile, GetScanInfo, and GetTuneData
	- Added function GetScanDataSumScans
	- Added support for scan filter text NSI SIM pr

Version 1.1.5459; December 16, 2014
	- GetScanData2D now has attribute HandleProcessCorruptedStateExceptions, allowing us to catch exceptions raised by MSFileReader.XRawfile2.dll

Version 1.1.5415; October 29, 2014
	- Removed ByRef parameter udtScanHeaderInfo from GetScanData and GetScanData2D since it wasn't being used (and wasn't being populated)
		- Left old functions in place for compatibility reasons

Version 1.1.5323; July 29, 2014
	- Fixed logic bug in GetScanData while validating that data is sorted by m/z

Version 1.1.5045; October 25, 2013
	- Added ability to centroid spectra
		- However, the mass calibration of the centroided data may be off by several hundred ppm, so this option should be used with caution

Version 1.1.5044; October 23, 2013
	- Now assuring that the data returned by GetScanData is sorted by m/z
		- It usually is sorted, but there are some edge cases where a pair of data points are swapped in the 2D array returned by GetMassListFromScanNum

Version 1.1.5025; October 4, 2013
	- Added function GetScanData2D

Version 1.1.4757; January 9, 2013
	- Added support for scan filter text with Full msx ms2
		- Used with multiplexed parent ion selection

Version 1.1.4661; October 5, 2012
	- Added function GetCollisionEnergy

Version 1.1.4492; April 19, 2012
	- Now determining the Ion Mode for each scan (positive or negative)
	- Now using <Out()> for ByRef parameters that are really out parameters (improves compatibility with C#)

Version 1.1.4462; March 20, 2012
	- Now setting String values to Nothing prior to calling XRawFile functions that return string values via a pbstr variable

Version 1.1.4461; March 19, 2012
	- Switched from xrawfile2.dll to MSFileReader.XRawfile2.dll
		- New version supports Xcalibur v2.2
	- Updated to .NET Framework 4.0

Version 1.0.4309; October 19, 2011
	- Added support for CRM in the scan filter text
