The Thermo Raw File Reader is a .NET DLL that demonstrates how to read Thermo-Finnigan .Raw files using Thermo's RawFileReader.

### Description
The Thermo Raw File Reader DLL provides several methods for parsing the information returned by Thermo's RawFileReader, including:

* Determining the parent ion m/z and fragmentation mode in a given scan filter
* Determining the Ionization mode from a given scan filter
* Extracting MRM masses listed in a given scan filter
* Reporting the number of spectra in the .Raw file
* Returning details on a specific spectrum
* Obtaining the raw m/z and intensity values for a given spectrum

Also available for download is a .NET command-line application that illustrates how to interface with ThermoRawFileReaderDLL.dll
